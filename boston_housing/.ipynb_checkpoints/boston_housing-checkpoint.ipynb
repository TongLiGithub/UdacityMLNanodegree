    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "- `'RM'`: An increase in the number of rooms would lead to an increase in the value of `'MEDV'`, for more rooms usually means larger size. Larger houses usually take up more land, require more raw materials to build and maintain, thus should have higher total value. \n",
    "- `'LSTAT'`: A higher value in the percent of lower class workers would lead to a lower value in the value of `'MEDV'`. This is because people of \"lower class\" are ususally poor, and would not spend a lot of money on expensive stuff that improves their living conditions. Therefore, the \"living quality\" in the surrounding environment may not be very attractive to \"upper class\" people who are more likely to accept higher price when purchasing a house. Another reason is that due to some stereotype, people tend to relate \"lower class\" societies to higher crime rates, so they would probably not consider a neighborhood with more lower class workers as a good choice.\n",
    "- `'PTRATIO'`: A higher value in ratio of students to teachers would lead to a lower value in the value of `'MEDV'`. This is similar to the situation for the lower clcass workers: students usually have lower income (or have no income) so they cannot afford luxurious living conditions. Therefore the surrounding neighbourbood may not be attractive to people who want to pay a high price for housing."

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

If we use all our data for training, we may get a good model for the training data, but in this situation we can hardly control overfitting, which means that the model can perform very well for our training data, but it may be too good for this specific dataset and cannot be well generalized to some new data which is not entirely the same. Therefore, by splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets, we can reduce the possibility of overfitting, for the model is already tested and evaluate with the validation data subset. Usually a larger part of the data is used in training subset to ensure the model won't be underfitting. "

    "**Answer: **   \n",
    "I select the graph with the maximum_depth = 3. As more training points are added, the score of the training curve went down a little bit from 1.0 and then reached about 0.8 and became stable there. On the other hand, as more training points are added, the testing curve went up from 0 and then stablized around 0.8.      \n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, the first 50 data points largely changed both the training and testing curve. Then from 50 to 300 training points, both curves are still converging, but the rate is smaller compared to the first 50 data points. When the amount of data points reached 300, the training and testing curves already converged together, so adding more data would not change much on the curves. So I think when we have fewer data (i.e., < 300), the more data we have the better for the model. But once the amount of data reaches 300, it is not necessary to add more data. In fact, if collecting data is expensive in this case, more than 300 data points will be even more unnecessary.   "

    "When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, the model suffers from high bias, for both the training score and the validation score are low (training score: about 0.45; validation score: about 0.3). Here the scores are R^2 scores, which means that with a maximum depth of 1, the model can only predict 45% of the variation of the price for training data, and can only predict 30% of the variation of the price for validation data.  \n",
    "However, when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10, we can see that the training and testing curves don't converge. To be specific, the training score was always as high as 1.0, whereas the testing score reached 0.7 and then stayed there. This pattern shows that the model suffers from high variance, for some changes in the data (from training data to testing data) lead to significant change in the model's score (drops from 1.0 to 0.7) and adding more training data cannot improve the model. This means that the model is overfitting, and cannot generalize well on testing data. "

    "**Answer: **   I think a maximum depth of 3 or 4 would result in a model that best generalizes to unseen data. Among the four graphs, maximum depth of 3 is the best, for it gives a relatively high score for both training and testing data (the two curves converge at about 0.8). When maximum depth was 1, the two curves converged but the score was low (at about 0.5), which means the model had high bias. When the maximum depth was 6 or 10, the two curves didn't converge and the training curve was always higher than the testing score, which means the model suffers from overfitting. Therefore among the four maximum depth, 3 is the best. I would say a maximum depth of 3 or 4 because I think model with maximum of 4 might have a higher score at which the two curves converge.  "

    "Some models have multiple hyper-parameters which are not directly learned within estimators. Different combinations of different values of these hyper-parameters will affect the model's performance. Grid search technique in fact helps us generate a set of models (which differ from each other in their hyper-parameter values, which lie on a grid). Then we can train each of the models and evaluate it using cross-validation, and select the one that performed best.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "To be specific, for a SVM model, kernel and C are two of its hyper-parameters. If we are considering two types of kernels (linear and polynomial) and three values of C (0.1, 1, 10),  then using grid search we can try all the combinations of the values of the two hyper-parameters, i.e., six combinations. Then with grid search technique we can try all the six combinations and pick the model which has the highest score. "

    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that.

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "The k-fold cross-validation training is to partition the original training data set into k equal subsets (folds), then each time use one fold as validation set and use all the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. Each time the model is trained using the training set and the accuracy of the model is calculated by validating the predicted results against the validation set. The accuracy of the model then is evaluated by averaging the accuracies derived in all the k cases of cross validation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search is a good technique which helps us find the best combination of hyper-parameters for the model. However, there is a potential problem of overfitting, which means that it is possible that although the combination of the hyper-parameters is the best for the training data, it may be not that good when generalize to new data. Therefore, k-fold cross validation is especially useful to grid search, because by training the model with (k-1)/k of the data and validating the predicted results with 1/k of the data for k times, we can monitor the overfitting problem for the final model.

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "**Answer: **  The Average annual inflation rate is 3.22% since the U.S. government began tracking it in 1913. It means that at that rate prices will double every 20 years. Therefore, since it is already 40 years since when the data was collected, I think the data probably cannot precisely predict today's price. However, the trend of how the predictors affect the price should still be meaningful, i.e., how the number of rooms, percent of lower class workers, and ratio of students to teachers affect the price should remain the same even after 40 years. So this model is still a good reference when we want to predict today's house price, but the exact price cannot be generated from it.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The features in the data are not sufficient to describe a home. There are other important factors that can significantly affect the price of a house, for example, the age of the house, the location of the house, quality of appliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, and presence of pool or not, etc, should also affect the price. Therefore, the current model might not be robust enough to make consistent predictions, for we don't know whether there are any interactions between the current three factors and other potential factors. Among these factors, some are about the house itself (like the quality of appliances and whether the house is old or new), and others are about the neighbourhood (like the location of the house), so simply knowing the house itself or only evaluating the neighbourhood quality cannot make a food prediction. In addition, if demand for houses increases faster than supply, then house price goes up. So the price is determined by multiple factors from various aspects, and the current model is not good enough."
